## Ancient Cache of Technologies Localization

This repository contains the `localization` folder of the Stellaris mod *Ancient Cache of Technologies.*

Currently only English is actively worked on, but this repository may include translations at a later date.

Contributions both to replace placeholder entries and to clean up spelling, grammar, etc. on existing entries are encouraged. Please fork and make a pull request to this repository if you would like to contribute.

All pull requests will be reviewed for accuracy versus established ACOT information, existing localization, and any other lore concerns. Discrepancies or issues will be resolved through comment threads.
